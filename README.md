# Our solution

Our solution consists of two main steps -- preprocessing and training. We will discuss each of these steps below.

## Preprocessing

For each 30s mp3 file we first transform it into a timeseries using 22050 sampling rate. Next for this timeseries we perform STFT (short time fourier transformation) on each three-seconds clip with a 1.5 seconds overlap. Thus in total we get 19 STFTs for each mp3 file and the corresponding class label is assigned to all of them.

## Training
We used Keras framework to train our neural network. Below you can find its architecture in functional API. 

```python
inputs = Input(shape=input_shape)

x = BatchNormalization()(inputs)
x = Conv2D(256, kernel_size=(4, cols), activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape)(x)
shortcut = x
x = Conv2D(256, kernel_size=(4, 1), activation='relu', padding='same')(x)
x = Conv2D(256, kernel_size=(4, 1), activation='relu', padding='same')(x)

x = Conv2D(256, kernel_size=(4, 1), activation='relu', padding='same')(x)
x = Conv2D(256, kernel_size=(4, 1), activation='relu', padding='same')(x)

x1 = AveragePooling2D(pool_size=(125, 1))(keras.layers.concatenate([x, shortcut]))
x2 = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(125, 1))(keras.layers.concatenate([x, shortcut]))

x = Dropout(0.2)(keras.layers.concatenate([x1, x2]))
x = Flatten()(x)
x = Dense(480, activation='relu')(x)
x = Dropout(0.2)(x)
x = Dense(240, activation='relu')(x)
x = Dropout(0.2)(x)

pred = Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(x)
```

We optimized categorical crossentropy using Adadelta with default parameters. For validation purposes we used accuracy.
```python
model.compile(loss=keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy,
optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adadelta(),
metrics=['acc'])
```



Also we have tried to incorporate bidirectional LSTM into our model, but without success. You can find this failed layer below

```python
z = MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 1))(inputs)
z = Lambda(lambda y: K.squeeze(y, 3))(z)
z = Embedding(input_dim=200000, output_dim=128, input_length=100)(z)
z = Bidirectional(LSTM(256, return_sequences=False))(z)
z = Lambda(lambda y: K.reshape(y, (-1,1,1,512)))(z)
```



## Predictions

For each test point we carry out the same preprocessing as in the training step. The final probabilities are computed by averaging 19 predictions obtained on the trackâ€™s STFT data.
